# Visualization for Gridworld policy evaluation example

## Version 1
This is an implementation of [this](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf#page=99) Gridworld example from the book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Sutton and Barto. The GUI is implemented using [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news). The backend is implemented using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). In the example the Agent receives a reward of -1 for each move except in the terminal states where it receives 0. We want to evaluate an equiprobable random policy. The user can change the terminal states and can do 10 iterations of policy evaluation when hitting Space.
